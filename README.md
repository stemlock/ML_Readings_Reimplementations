# Machine Learning Readings Re-implementations in Python
Re-implementations of various problems and ML algorithms from a corpus of external papers/articles. Each re-implementation is included in a separate directory. The source article is included in each directory as a PDF. The following is a list of the different sources that have been reimplmented:

- ["Predicting customer churn with scikit-learn" by Eric Chiang](predicting_customer_churn/)
