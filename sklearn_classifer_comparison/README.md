# "Classifier Comparison" by scikit-learn
A comparison of various classifiers including KNN, Logistic Regression, SVMs, Decision Trees, Ensembled Trees, Neural Networks, and Naive Bayes. The decision boundaries that were produced are plotted and respective prediction accuracy scores displayed.

### Libraries:
  - sklearn
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  
### Algorithms:
  - K-Nearest-Neighbor
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine
  	- 	Linear kernel
  	-  Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - AdaBoost
  - Neural Network
  - Naive Bayes
  
### Techniques:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Contour plots for decision boundaries
  - Hyperparameter tuning
